An online store app written in React with a backend in NodeJS using a MongoDb.

# Running it
The easiest way is through Docker. If you run ```docker-compose up``` in the repo, there will be two docker containers started.
One with a MongoDB on Port 27017 and the other with the node app running in development mode.

Don't worry about ```npm install```. This will be run on start of the node container.
